        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>This website is static and hosted on GitHub Pages. <strong>We do not collect, store, or process any personal data</strong> on our servers (names, emails, IP addresses, etc.). We do not have a database and we do not use tracking pixels or analytics software.</p>

        <h2>2. Local Storage & Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use a technology called <strong>Local Storage</strong> solely for the purpose of the "Age Gate" functionality. This saves a small piece of data on your device (`ageConfirmed = true`) to remember that you have verified your age, so you don't have to confirm it every time you visit. This data remains on your device and is never sent to us.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>This site contains links to third-party platforms such as <strong>Patreon</strong> and <strong>Discord</strong>. Once you leave our website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those other sites. We encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>4. Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions, you can contact us via our official Patreon page.</p>
